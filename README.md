# Transfer Window for KSP 2
## (Formerly ABrit's Transfer Calculator)
An in-game interplanetary transfer calculator for KSP 2, including dV estimates and current/desired phase angles.

- Phase angle: Your current phase angle between the planet you're orbiting and the target planet.
- Target angle: The desired phase angle for the most optimal transfer.
- Eject DeltaV: The estimated change in velocity required to get a transfer (does not include plane changes).

## Install

1. Download [SpaceWarp](https://github.com/SpaceWarpDev/SpaceWarp) and install as follows
2. Drag the folder within the zip ("InterplanetaryCalc") into KSP_ROOT/BepInEx/plugins
3. Have fun! If there are any issues, contact me via discord (ABritInSpace#0752)
